# Building a "Scrollytelling Map"

The scrollytelling map I made features the key events happened in the Supply Chain history, starting from the 1920s when Ford developed a mass production model to produce Ford's Model A. The map then introduces the user to three other major events from Toyota, Walmart, and IBM. At the end of the map tour, the user will have a brief understanding of the Supply Chain development timeline, as well as where did those events take place at.
